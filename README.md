I find this website to learn CSS helpful when it comes to almost everything about CSS and also beginning to learn it. The way it is also formatted makes it easy to use and provides examples along with resources to use.

Unlike the other resource, this one is more interactive. The lessons for HTML and CSS are FREE which is good for anyone who is starting off. The rest is paid for but the indeph first free chapters on HTML give a beginner more than enough information as this information is usally paid for.
